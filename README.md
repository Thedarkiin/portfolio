## 📖 The Origin Story

When i was learning java, i came across an exercice about creating a particle class its velocity and acceleration, and i wanted so bad to simulate it, i asked dear Chatgpt how can i do so ? The answer : **Three.js**.
I was fascinated by the idea, then i forgot lol ( i had to study for the exam so bad).

I remembered later, and the spark finally came when I scrolled past a LinkedIn post about a **"Cozy Homes" Three.js competition**. It was inspiring and the results were so cool. I decided its time to build something.

Coming from a little boy who once loved **RPG games**, I understood the logic (Object-Oriented Programming, game loops, physics), so i used this knowledge and some basic prompt engineering techniques, and Voilaa.

### The Experiment

I set a challenge for myself: **Could I vibe code a complete 3D engine?**

This project is **Prompt Engineered**. Using my humble knowledge of OOP and game logic, i directed Gemini PRO 3 to build specific modules (Ocean, Sky, Physics, NPC AI). I guided the architecture, and refined the "feel," while Gemini handled the heavy lifting and rendering code.

## 🎮 Features

- **The Whale:** A massive, procedurally generated whale that breaches the surface.
- **The Guardian:** A floating NPC inspired by a Onepiece character (**Luffy** 👒). He waits for you near the island.
- **The ships:** Two pirate ships sailing through the sea.
- **Dynamic Cycle:** A full Day/Night system with Rayleigh scattering sky gradients and fog.
- **Physics & Interaction:**
  - Sailable boat with momentum and drag.
  - Working cannon system with particle explosions.
  - Lightning Storm simulation (appears a random amount of time each 5-10 seconds).
- **Audio Engine:** One Piece The worlds number one Oden store ( external .mp3)

## 🛠️ How to Build Your Own (The Workflow)

If you want to build something similar, you don't need to memorize the entire Three.js documentation. You need **Logic** and **Iteration**.

1.  **Think in Modules (OOP):** Don't ask for "a game." Ask for classes. "Create a `Boat` class," "Create an `AudioEngine` class."
2.  **Start Simple:** I started with just a dragon not even a real one (it was a triangle shape, inside a ball, with rectangular wings) haha.
3.  **Refine visually:** Use terms like "Low luminosity", "Rayleigh scattering", "Gradient colors" to get better visuals.
4.  **Iterate:** When a bug happens, paste the console error. When the physics feels wrong, explain *how* it feels wrong (e.g., "The boat slides too much, add friction").
